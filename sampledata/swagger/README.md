# Swagger Docs

API document is an auto generated json that descrivbes our BBTI API as [OpenAPIv2](https://swagger.io/specification/v2/) format.

The easiest way to check JSON is paste it to the [swagger editor](https://editor.swagger.io/).

# NOTE
The json is under enhancement and yet to fully describe our API. 

The API interface, request, response, server, authentication and anything else would be changed in the future.
